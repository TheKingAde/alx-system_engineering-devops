# Web infrastructure design

This was a week-long project in which we began to research web infrastructure design. As we conducted research on different design principles, we whiteboarded diagrams of a developing web infrastructure. We started with a simple LAMP model and ended with a fully distributed, monitored, and secured system.

This dir contains solution files for the alx web infrastructure design project

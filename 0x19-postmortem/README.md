- **3:00 PM**: Initial assumption was a database deadlock, but this was a misleading path.
- **3:30 PM**: Incident escalated to the senior backend team.
- **4:30 PM**: Root cause identified as a memory leak in the payment processing module.
- **4:45 PM**: Hotfix applied, and the service was restored.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Cause**: In-depth analysis showed that a new feature deployment did not handle memory allocation efficiently, causing a leak.
- **Resolution**: The team rolled back the recent deployment and applied a hotfix to patch the memory management issue.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements**: Enhance code review processes and increase monitoring on critical services.
- **Tasks**:
  - Review and improve the deployment checklist.
  - Implement automated rollback for failed deployments.
  - Patch the payment processing module to handle memory allocation correctly.
